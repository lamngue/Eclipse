Hours to complete assignment (optional):

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe how you came up with your own fractal (that is, by 
 *  experimentation or did you find the fractal on the web).  I don't
 *  mind if you find an interesting fractal pattern on the web or from
 * a book, so long as you tell me _and_ you don't get the code for
 * programming the fractal from the web or from a book.
 **********************************************************************/
By experimentation, I think the code will be similar to the drawSquare code

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) that you received. You don't need to
 *  include the course materials or lectures, but do include any
 *  additional help your received from people (course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates) and include their names.
